# FriendFinder

## We're taking on Facebook baby!!

### Just kidding of course. This app finds you your soulmate. Provided, of course, that you're soulmate has also used this app and is in our database. Otherwise, you might just match with a random person.


## How to Use It:
* Once at the homepage of the app, click `survey` to navigate to the survey page
* on the survey page, enter your name, a url link to a picture of yourself, and fill out the survey
* hit submit
* your data will then be processed by our very complex algorithm and find the person who best matches your unique personality
* the app will then display your match's info

## Note: this app is not quite finished...
* I still need to have the match information appear as a modal pop-up. Right not it just displays to the apge as a JSON object
* I need to add in data validation, to make sure that the user completes all the fields in the form
* I need to significantly improve the UI, likely using bootstrap or some other css framework
* I need to put in the actual questions (i promise i have them written out, i didn't add them in yet)
* This all being the case, the basic logic is all in place
